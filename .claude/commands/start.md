# Session Start

Execute the session start protocol:

## Step 1: Load Context
1. Read `brain/context.md` for current state
2. Read the latest `notes/daily-summaries/closing-*.md` file (if exists)

## Step 2: Propose
Summarize in max 5 bullet points:
- What was done in last session (if closing exists)
- What is pending
- Current focus from context

Then ask: **"Confirm these priorities or change?"**

## Step 3: STOP
**Wait for response before proceeding.**

Don't load other files, don't take other actions. Wait for the user.
